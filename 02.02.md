Rudi wakes up to a vibration on his leg. He rolls over in a half sleep, and
feels the bed disappear from beneath him. He hits the ground and groans. A blunt
pain blooms in his shoulder and slowly throbs him awake. Too late, he remembers
that he slept on a sofa.

His pocket vibrates again.

Rudi pulls his cell phone out of his pocket and checks the texts.

```
Twitterpated:   Where are you.
Twitterpated:   What floor.
```

Rudi crinkles his brow. After testing “the resistance,” Twitterpated went
silent. Rudi flooded him with texts but got nothing back. _Now he wants to know
where I am?_ Rudi thinks. _What the fuck?_

```
Rudi:           I’m in the NYJ building.
Twitterpated:   Duh. What floor.
```

Rudi looks up from his phone, an increasingly familiar uneasiness filling his
stomach and driving his mind toward full wakefulness. He looks back at the
screen. _How does he know where I am?_

```
Rudi:           I’m in the bullpit.
Twitterpated:   Then heads up.
Twitterpated:   You got company.
Rudi:           What?
Twitterpated:   NYPD are on their way up.
```

Rudi stands.

```
Rudi:           How do you know?
Twitterpated:   Trust me.
Twitterpated:   Prepare for boarding.
```

Rudi peaks through the blinds into the bullpit. There are just a few reporters
in the room. And Reese. The early birds. It’s only 6:30.

Rudi opens the door to the bullpit and walks out of the office. “Did security
call?”

Reese, on the other side of the bullpit, looks up from the desk he’s standing
by, bemused. The other reporters look, too.

“No,” Reese says. “Why?”

“Twitterpated says the NYPD are on their way up.”

“What?” Reese asks. “How would he know that?”

Rudi shrugs. “I don’t know. He just texted me.”

One of the elevators suddenly slides open. It’s packed with bodies. None of them
are reporters. Two in front are instantly recognizable to Rudi and Reese. One of
them is dark-skinned with black hair and a calm smile. The other is WASPy white
with chestnut hair and a smirking grin.

Mason and Patel walk forward and the elevator begins to empty behind them. While
cops disperse around the room, Mason and Patel stroll toward Reese, Mason
jauntily, Patel mechanically.

“So...” Mason says, still smirking. “The Journal just makes shit up now, huh?”

Rudi stands stock still outside the office he slept in. He feels  his pocket
vibrate. He ignores it.

“Shouldn’t surprise you, really,” Patel says. “They’ve always had it out for the
boys in blue.”

Mason nods. “All that liberal ideology gets to your head.”

“Damn right,” says Patel. “Shit, when I used to read the Journal I started to
hate _myself_. Had to switch to the Tribune. What about you, Steve? What do
_you_ read?”

“Me? I’m a Times man, like my dad. And his dad before him. You might say we’re a
Times family.”

“Really,” Patel says, feigning a deep curiosity. “I’ve heard of that sort of
thing before. Generational. Likie blue dogs, huh?”

“Sure, I guess you could say that,” Mason nods, pursing his lips like a bulldog.
He turns to look at Reese. “What about you, McGraw? Have you always read trash
or did you used to read a real newspaper?”

While this performance is transpiring Rudi notices the other cops rummaging
through unoccupied desks, crumpling papers, and harassing the reporters who came
in to work early.

“What the fuck is this!” Reese shoues. “Rudi, call security.”

Rudi turns to go back into the office.

“Hold it,” Mason says, holding up a hand. He turns to look at Rudi, stopping him
midturn. “You’re Rudd?”

Rudi feels his throat constrict. He nods. Of the two he’d rather deal with
Patel. A quick temper doesn’t scare him nearly as much as Mason’s cold,
calculated, execution-style killings.

“My father recognized your name,” Mason says. “You’re not the son of the SDS
president, are you? From the Weather Underground?”

Rudi swallows. He can’t tell if this is grudging respect or callous hatred. He
tries to find his voice.

“Grandson,” he finally manages.

“Rudi, call security,” Reese implores.

Rudi can’t move his feet.

“Your grandfather was a communist and a terrorist. The only reason he’s not in
prison is because the FBI overstepped its bounds with COINTELPRO.”

Rudi begins to shake. His fists clench.

“WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING FUCKHEAD!?” Reese shouts. “YOU DON’T
HAVE A WARRANT!” He turns to Rudi. “Rudi. Call security. Now.”

Rudi’s legs unfreeze. He rushes into the office to pick up the phone and dial
the extension for security. He hears Reese shouting at the other cops in the
bullpit, threatening legal action.

The phone rings twice.

“Security.”

“We have intruders on the twenty-third floor.”

“Should I call the authorities?”

“Don’t bother,” Rudi says. “Just send a large security escort. There’s eleven of
them.”

“Yes, sir.”

Rudi hangs up.

WHen he returns to the bullpit he sees that the officers have stopped searching
the desks and are retreating back toward the elevators. Reese is still shouting,
holding up his cellphone now and filming them now. Mason and Patel are dawdling,
following their officers back.

“Did you call them?” Reese asks over his shoulder.

“Yeah,” Rudi says. “They’re sending a team.”

“This won’t be the end of this!” Patel shouts from the elevator.

“You’ll be hearing from our lawyers, jackass!” Reese shouts back. The elevator
doors slide closed and the bullpit is peaceful again.

Rudi looks around the corner. Paper is strewn everywhere. Drawers are hanging
open. Entire desks have been overturned. Reporters, typically calm in the face
of fire, look deeply shaken.

“You okay?” Reese asks.

Rudi nods.

“Well, that was fucked up,” Reese states matter-of-factly.

Rudi laughs.
