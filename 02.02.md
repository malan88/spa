Rudi wakes up to a vibration on his leg. He rolls over in a half sleep, and
feels the bed disappear from beneath him. He hits the ground and groans. A blunt
pain blooms in his shoulder and slowly throbs him awake. Too late, he remembers
that he slept on a sofa.

His pocket vibrates again.

Rudi pulls his cell phone out of his pocket and checks the texts.

```
Twitterpated:   Where are you.
Twitterpated:   What floor.
```

Rudi crinkles his brow. After testing “the resistance,” Twitterpated went
silent. Rudi flooded him with texts but got nothing back. _Now he wants to know
where I am?_ Rudi thinks. _What the fuck?_

```
Rudi:           I’m in the NYJ building.
Twitterpated:   Duh. What floor.
```

Rudi looks up from his phone, an increasingly familiar uneasiness filling his
stomach and driving his mind toward full wakefulness. He looks back at the
screen. _How does he know where I am?_

```
Rudi:           I’m in the bullpit.
Twitterpated:   Then heads up.
Twitterpated:   You got company.
Rudi:           What?
Twitterpated:   NYPD are on their way up.
```

Rudi stands.

```
Rudi:           How do you know?
Twitterpated:   Trust me.
Twitterpated:   Prepare for boarding.
```

Rudi peaks through the blinds into the bullpit. There are just a few reporters
in the room. And Reese. The early birds. It’s only 6:30.

Rudi opens the door to the bullpit and walks out of the office. “Did security
call?”

Reese, on the other side of the bullpit, looks up from the desk he’s standing
by, bemused. The other reporters look, too.

“No,” Reese says. “Why?”

“Twitterpated says the NYPD are on their way up.”

“What?” Reese asks. “How would he know that?”

Rudi shrugs. “I don’t know. He just texted me.”

One of the elevators suddenly slides open. It’s packed with bodies. None of them
are reporters. Two in front are instantly recognizable to Rudi and Reese. One of
them is dark-skinned with black hair and a calm smile. The other is WASPy white
with chestnut hair and a smirking grin.

Mason and Patel walk forward and the elevator begins to empty behind them. While
cops disperse around the room, Mason and Patel stroll toward Reese, Mason
jauntily, Patel mechanically.

“So...” Mason says, still smirking. “The Journal just makes shit up now, huh?”

Rudi stands stock still outside the office he slept in. He feels  his pocket
vibrate. He ignores it.

“Shouldn’t surprise you, really,” Patel says. “They’ve always had it out for the
boys in blue.”

Mason nods. “All that liberal ideology gets to your head.”

“Damn right,” says Patel. “Shit, when I used to read the Journal I started to
hate _myself_. Had to switch to the Tribune. What about you, Steve? What do
_you_ read?”
