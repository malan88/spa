The doorbell rings.

“I’ll get it!” Caroline yells, running for the door.

“Damnit, Caroline!”

Rudi hears the door open and male voice sin the foyer. He does not approve of
Caroline’s party idea.

Caroline walks back into the living room with two guys in tow, both really tall,
both dark-haired.

“Sup, dude,” the slightly taller one says.

Rudi nods.

“I’m Teddy.”

“Rudi.”

“We know,” they both say in unison.

Rudi sighs.

The shorter one holds out his hand. He has a darker complexion. “Jack.”

Rudi shakes it. He turns to Caroline.

“Caroline,” he whines. “You can’t—”

“We understand you’re a little paranoid,” Jack says.

“I’m not paranoid,” Rudi says. “I just have two murderers wearing badges out
there on a grudge-hunt for me and Caroline’s got a Facebook event page up with
my picture saying ‘COME MEET RUDI RUDD!’”

Jack holds up a hand. “We got it.” He turns to Teddy. “Blackout party?”

Teddy nods, grinning. “Blackout party.”
