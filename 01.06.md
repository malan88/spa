“I got him talking.”

“Twitterpated?”

Rudi nods. He and Reese are standing in the middle of the Bullpit for their
meeting.

“And?” Reese asks.

“Video was made on a cheap laptop and webcam set to record motion from the
fourth floor of the building across from the parking garage.”

“Any reason for the sharp cut-off?”

“He says the laptop was plugged into the wall and didn’t have any batteries in
it. The power must’ve cut out. With no batteries, the laptop shut down. He said
it was off when he found it. It’s an abandoned building so I believe him.”

“That’s terrible timing,” Reese says. “It had to shut down right after the
shooting and before the first responders came.”

“At least it didn’t shut down before the shooting,” Rudi says. “True.”

“I just don’t get why there weren’t any batteries in it. Laptops come with
batteries. It’s not like you have to buy them separate.”

Reese shrugs. “Secrets of the dead.”

“I guess,” Rudi says.

“I sent the video to three different experts we keep on call. First look all
three say it’s real. Which means, if it’s fake, it’s a damn good fake. Which I
doubt.”

“And if you’re wrong?” Rudi asks.

“Not likely. Video is way harder to forge than pictures. And when it is there’s
artifacts that show up. So we’ll find out in a couple of hours. It has several
rounds of testing to go through, independent testing, before the Journal can
risk its name with a stamp of approval. If it’s fake, we’ll find out.”

Rudi nods.

“We’ve got a lot to do,” Reese says. “Let’s not dwell for now. I’m going to task
some people. Let’s meet here every half hour. Okay?”

“Yeah.”

“Let’s get to work.”
