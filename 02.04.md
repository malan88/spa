The bullpit is filled with security guards. Reese is talking to their head
officer, recounting what happened and asking how the police got past security in
the first place.

Rudi’s sitting on a desk feeling pathetic and angry. Mason had not rouble
unmanning him. He resolves himself _never_ to let that sort of thing happen
again. _When you come to a cliff_, he tells himself, _don’t think, just jump_.

Rudi’s pocket vibrates. He remembers that he got a text when Mason and Patel
showed up. He pulls out his phone.

```
Twitterpated:   How many are there?
Twitterpated:   Are they gone yet?
```

_So he doesn’t know everything_, Rudi thinks.

```
Rudi:           There were 11.
Rudi:           They left 10 mins ago.
Twitterpated:   Check for bugs.
```

Rudi looks up. Reese has finished talking with the head of security and is
walking this way.

“Robinson says the guy at the security desk this morning was just a rookie,”
Reese says when he gets close. “He didn’t even ask for a warrant. He just saw
the badtes and let them up.”

“Twitterpated says we should check for bugs.”

“Already on it,” Reese says. “They’re searching for them but I doubt they’ll
find any. This was pure harrassment.”

“That’s definitely what it felt like.”

“What I want to know,” Reese says, “is how Twitterpated knew they were coming.
Does he have us under surveillance? Or the police?”

“Or just me,” Rudi says, shrugging. “Or all three.”

Reese nods. “Whichever it is, and _whoever_ he is, we can be sure there’s more
to Twitterpated than he’s letting on.”

“Did I tell you he must’ve spent some time in prison?”

“No,” Reese says. “How do you know?”

“He used the word ‘shiteater.’”

“Prison slang,” Reese says knowingly. “That’s important.”

Rudi nods. “I found out online.”

“Does he have the cop-hate?”

“Cop-hate?”

Reese nodes. Sometimes when people spend enough time in prison they get mean.
Hateful. The police are the focus of it. Everything wrong in their lives is
because of the cops. These people cheer when cops get shot.”

Rudi’s brow begins to knit. He wonders who he’s dealing with. “How do you know
all this?”

“I investigated a lot of abuse stories on Riker’s Island when I first started.
Those guys have good reason to hate the polcie. Most of them have nothing to
live for in the first place and they just get beaten down more. They become
animals. No dignity, no shame. But the ones whoc ome from good people, who used
to _be_ something and lost it all...” Reese trails off, getting a faraway look
in his eyes. “Most of them turn out all right. But some of them...” He trails
off again. “It changes them...”

Rudi watches the guards sweep the desk for bugs. Reporters steadily arrive by
the elevators, shocked by the state of the bullpit. Reese continues to stand in
silence, reliving something he saw on Riker’s Island.

Reese wakes back up. “You know, Rudi, I think you should take the day off.”

Rudi’s taken aback. “What!? But there’s so much left to do!”

Reese is nodding. “And we’ll take care of it. But you’re still very much an
amateur and you had a big day yesterday.”

Rudi’s jaw is slack. “What the fuck, dude?”

Reese shakes his head. “Calm down. We’ll still have plenty to report. This story
is going to dominate the news cycle for the next month. There’ll still be
stories left when you get back to work tomorrow. Plenty to cut your teeth on.”

“Is this because I choked?”

“Yes,” Reese says bluntly. “Go home, have a drink, watch a movie. Unwind.”

Rudi nods, resigning himself to a boring day. Reese claps a hand on his back.
“Chill, dude. I’d kill for a day off.”

Rudi smirks. He looks up around the bullpit. “Most widely circulated newspaper
in the world? On a day like this? You’re full of shit.”

“Well,” Reese says, shrugging. “you know, it sounded good.” He claps Rudi’s back
again. “Doesn’t matter, take the day off. Go sit in on a drum circle or a poetry
reading or something. Whatever you Columbians do when you have free time.”

Rudi snorts and nods. He stands up and begins walking toward the elevators.

“And no more earth-shattering story leads!” Reese shouts at his back.

Rudi flicks him off over his shoulder and takes an open elevator.
