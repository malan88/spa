Twitterpated: _I found it in the building across from the parking garage._

Twitterpated: _On the 4th floor._

Rudi smiles. He emailed twitterpated@omxwbh.bizz just five minutes ago. Now the
texts are rolling in. His phone is spasming in his hand.

Twitterpated: _It was an off the shelf webcam hooked to a cheap laptop._

Twitterpated: _Plugged into a wall socket._

Twitterpated: _No batteries._

Twitterpated: _There were 3 video files. It was set to record motion._

Twitterpated: _I sent the only video file that had any action._

Rudi: _Thatâ€™s it? No footage of first responders? Twitterpated: No, it just cuts
out._

Twitterpated: _Power is intermittent in that building. Twitterpated: It went out
for 15 mins just while I was searching it._

Twitterpated: _It must of went out just before 1st responders came._
Twitterpated: _The laptop was off when I found it. Rudi: That sucks._
Twitterpated: _Ya._
