Twitterpated:   It was an off the shelf webcam hooked to a cheap laptop.
Twitterpated:   Plugged into a wall socket.
Twitterpated:   No batteries.
Twitterpated:   There were 3 video files. It was set to record motion.
Twitterpated:   I sent the only video file that had any action.
Rudi:           Thatâ€™s it? No footage of first responders? Twitterpated: No, it
                    just cuts out.
Twitterpated:   Power is intermittent in that building. 
Twitterpated:   It went out for 15 mins just while I was searching it.
Twitterpated:   It must of went out just before 1st responders came.
Twitterpated:   The laptop was off when I found it.
Rudi:           That sucks.
Twitterpated:   Ya.
