“This concerns everyone.”
-------------------------

SUNLIGHT seeps through the cracks in the blinds and scratches Rudi awake. He
throws the covers over his head and tries to nurse his sleep. But it’s no use.
By now he’s got his blood circulating and his mind is running down the same
tracks it’s been running for two weeks.

So far he’s found pretty much squat. Numerous FOIA requests, hours spent
scouring library databases, and countless interviews have all added up to
nothing. It might help if he knew what he was looking for. He feels like the
trail is going dead. If there ever even was one to begin with. He’s starting to
think Mack was right: he’s wasting his talents.

Nor has he heard anything else from his mysterious new friend. He sent several
texts to the 406 number trying to get more out of it, but so far nothing has
come. Hell, the number itself was a mystery: 406 was an area code for Montana.
His only break came from googling the word ‘shiteater’. And now Rudi can
honestly say his biggest break to date came from Urban Dictionary. Shiteater
turned out to be an insult inmates use for prison guards.

Rudi throws the covers off. He lies for a minute, trying to accept that he won’t
be falling back asleep and that he may as well give up trying. He rolls out of
bed.

He goes to the kitchen and makes himself a cup of coffee from the K-Cup machine.
He goes back to the living room, plops down on the couch, and turns on the news.
He watches a story about the Middle East. A handful of Senators, including Henry
Adams from New York, made a formal visit to one of our bases in Iraq. Rudi
already knew that.

He boots his laptop on the coffee table and checks his email. He has three new
ones. Two are work- related and he deletes them. The third makes him uneasy.

Rudi stares at the email until his pupils feel like pixels. He knows it’s not
spam. It doesn’t fit the profile. But it could be a virus, he thinks.

Rudi jumps up from the couch and grabs his cellphone off the counter. He opens a
two-week-old conversation in his text messages and compares it with the email.

```
4068486737:     I’m glad someone else is searching for the truth, too Rudi: Who the
                    fuck are you?
4068486737:     Just someone searching for the truth.
4068486737:     Someone who wants to bring these shiteaters to justice. 
```

Rudi looks back up at the screen.

Fuck it, Rudi thinks. It’s a company laptop. He double clicks the attachment.

The file is only 37 megabytes so it downloads almost instantly. VLC launches and
the video begins to play.

It’s twenty minutes long. After five minutes, Rudi is so sure that the
twitterpated email is from 4068486737 that he saves the number to his contacts
under that name. Then he closes his laptop and scrambles to get dressed. He
rushes out of the apartment, laptop under his arm, without even bothering to
brush his teeth. He’ll watch the rest of the video on the subway.
