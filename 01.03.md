MACK presses the intercom button on his phone. “Yes?” a voice answers, breaking
the deep silence. “Tell McGraw to meet me in my office,” Mack says.

“Mr. McGraw is in a meeting, sir.”

“Tell him we have a deep throat.”

“A what?”

“A deep throat. He’ll know what it means.”

Mack picks up the receiver and recradles it, ending the intercom call. A
stillness falls on the room again. Mack turns to Rudi.

“Do you remember who Deep Throat was?”

Rudi nods. “Of course. The FBI agent that leaked Watergate to Woodward and
Bernstein.”

“Yes,” Mack says. “A story that forced President Nixon to resign.”

“I remember. My grandfather made me watch the movie when I was a kid. All the
President’s Men.”

“Good. So you’ll understand when I say that a ‘deep throat’ is a story that
could topple governments.”

Rudi’s eyebrows go up. It occurs to him that they might be making history.

“Relax, Rudi,” Mack says. “I’m talking about City Hall. A police cover up is a
problem for Gracie Mansion, not the White House.”

The door opens and a tall, brown-haired, stern-looking man in his early thirties
walks in.

“Reese, you remember Rudi Rudd, right?” Mack asks.

Reese takes a look at Rudi and shakes his head. “No.”

“I talked to you about giving him an assignment two weeks ago. He’s the
columnist that wants to pursue a reporting career.”

“He’s an idiot,” Reese says.

“I told him the same thing,” Mack says. “But alas, he insists...”

Rudi smiles and holes out a hand. “Nice to meet you.”

Reese shakes it. “Stick to the column. There’s more money in it.” He turns to
Mack. “And?” he asks. “What’s the deep throat?”

“It’s about the Fletcher Street story.”

“The shooting?”

“Yeah. You remember the details?”

“Mack, it was two weeks ago. Of course I remember.”

“Alright, well...” Mack nods to Rudi. Rudi hits play and flips the laptop
around. “Watch this,” Mack says.

Reese sits down in front of the desk. He stays stone faced throughout the entire
video. Mack and Rudi watch for any reaction but he gives away nothing. When it’s
over he looks up.

“How did you get this?” Reese asks Mack.

Mack points at Rudi.

“It was an anonymous source,” Rudi says. “You still have contact?”

“I’m not sure.”

“Not sure?”

“I have a phone number and email but I don’t know if he’ll respond.”

“He’ll respond,” Reese says.

Rudi crinkles his brow. “How do you know?”

“I’ve been doing this a while,” Reese says. “They always respond.”

“Reese, I want you running point on this but Rudi gets a by-line,” Mack says.
“It’s his source. He’s a good writer but he’s new to this. Break him easy.”

Reese nodes and leaves without another word. Mack looks at Rudi, still standing
by his side. “What are you still doing here?”

Rudi’s smile disappears.

“The Journal’s at Def Con 4,” Mack yells. “Get your ass moving!” Rudi scrambles
to grab his laptop and rushes out the door.

“Go go go!” Mack shouts. He bursts out laughing when Rudi’s gone.
