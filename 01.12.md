RUDI jumps at the obnoxious cacophony of his cellphone vibrating against the
desk. He takes his fingers off the keyboard and picks it up.

Twitterpated: _Update_?

Rudi laughs. After the meeting with the NPN he came back to the office to work
on his next column.

He’d forgotten all about Twitterpated.

Rudi glances at the clock on his desk. 9:37. The Bullpit is empty. He has an
urge to crash on a sofa in one of the empty offices lining the walls. This is
his first front page article—his first article—for the Journal and he kind of
wants to be here when the phones start ringing off the hook.

His cellphone vibrates again. Twice.

Twitterpated: _What’s the deal?_

Twitterpated: _Any news?_

Rudi: _You should pick up a copy of the New York Journal tomorrow morning._

Twitterpated: _Sweet._

Twitterpated: _What’s the headline?_

Rudi: _You’ll see it in the morning._

Twitterpated: _Detectives Murdered Four Youths In Cold Blood—Cover-Up_

Rudi stares at Twitterpated’s text. Cold blood. That was the exact headline they
went with. The only people that knew outside of the office were the NPN leaders.
Was it a lucky guess?

What are the fucking odds?

Rudi: _How did you know?_

Twitterpated: _We know about the protest tomorrow._

Twitterpated: _You should speak._

Rudi feels the hair on the back of his arms stand up.

Rudi: _Who’s we?_

Rudi watches his phone for a full minute without it vibrating.

Rudi: _Who do you work for?_

After another minute he gives up and sets his phone down. It vibrates. When he
picks it back up the answer is there.

Twitterpated: _The Resistance._
